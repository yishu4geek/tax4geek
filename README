Project: Tax4Geek
=====================================
Tax4Geek is the project I am creating for calculating the tax return for my geek friends.
Every tax season some of my geek friends would ask me to help them calculating the tax return due to my accounting knowledge.

For those young geeks, the tax return calculation are quite straight forward.
I was thinking why not just make a web application does the job for me and my friends.

Let's do it, a fun project, isn't?
